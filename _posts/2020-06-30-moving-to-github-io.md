Time flies, my main affiliation is no longer the University of Oslo. Therefore, I decided to move my personal website from [there](https://folk.uio.no/jeanra/welcome.html) to [this github.io website](https://jerabaul29.github.io/)! The old website will be progressively discontinued and may become unavailable in the future.
